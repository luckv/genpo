# Genpo

A python library and a simple CLI program to generate polynomials with roots simple to find by hand. The degree of the polynomial, the number of roots and the multiplicities of these roots, are all tweakable to generate polynomials with different grades of difficulty.

I started this library while studying for a math exam where it was required to quickly find the roots of a polynomial of degree 3 or 4. It helped me pass it.
