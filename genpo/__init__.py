    """
        Module for manipulating polynomials and generating random ones that are simple to resolve by hand

        Manipulation
        ----
        - polynomials: pure functions for creating polynomials from parameters
        - operations: sum, multiplication and evaluation in one point
        - roots: utilities functions when working with roots and multiplicities
        - representation: string representations

        Random generators
        ----
        Functions for generating random roots and polynomials. All values generated are simple to find for a human that resolve the problem by hand
        - values: generators for intervals of values, simple fractions or expanding randomly a list of items
        - roots: generators for random roots. All integers and simple to find
        - polynomials: generator for polynomials, with or without roots
